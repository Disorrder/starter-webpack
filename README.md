### How to run (fastest demo):
 - `npm i`
 - `sudo npm run gulp` (without sudo on Windows)
 - If browser didn't open automatically, console will show you address to open
 - Enjoy!

### Dedicated run
 - `sudo npm i -g gulpjs/gulp#4.0` (install once)
 - `sudo npm i` (each time after pull)
 - `sudo gulp demo`
